# forSoleSavy
Showcasing some select files from a recent project I'm working on to SoleSavy as an example of my coding skillset.

High level explanation of these files:

I am using spotify API to let a user search for songs and return that data back to me to list to the user. Once the user presses the song they want it will add the song data to a firestore database that I have set up and display the list of songs currently in that database in real time.
